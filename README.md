# schnitzel-rails-template

What's up, schnitzel lovers? Here's our own little Rails application
template, setting up fresh Rails applications with our favourite set
of gems and stuff.

## Usage

    rails new facebook2 -m http://git.io/schnitzel-rails-template -T

This will generate a new Rails app and use our little template
to add, well, things. Great things. Important things. You know.

Enjoy.
